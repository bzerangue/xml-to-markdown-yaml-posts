# xml-to-markdown-yaml-posts
Simple PHP script that reads from an XML file and outputs Markdown and YAML Frontmatter

- CURRENTLY very specific script, but need to setup as a generic XML reader, that will read the contents of the file and setup an easier setup to get YAML FrontMatter. So you can easily plug and play your generic XML file and gather info from that.


- Clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/bzerangue/xml-to-markdown-yaml-posts.git`
- `cd xml-to-markdown-yaml-posts`
- Run `php build-md.php` and it will populate a list of the churches (from the example file) in individual markdown files in the churches folder.
